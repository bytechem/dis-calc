# Dilution Equilibrium Calculator App

An app to facilitate the calculation of percent content of components and complex upon dilution of solutions of 
complex-forming solutes.

## Live preview

This app is deployed [here](https://bytechem.com/eq-calc).

## Support

This software is in early stages of development, and is currently provided as is, with no support. You are welcome to 
open issues, but at the moment, I will likely not be able to get to them.

## License

The current version of the code is released under an MIT license. If incorporating any parts of this code into 
closed-source software, include a notice clearly stating that your software:

> Incorporates source code from dilution equilibrium calculator - Copyright (c) 2019-2020 Igor Petrik 
> \- see <https://github.com/bytechem/dis-calc> for details.

## Create-React-App Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right 
into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will 
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you 
shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t 
customize it when you are ready for it.
